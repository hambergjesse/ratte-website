# Requirements & Features

## Objectives and Goals

- **Centralized Brand & Affiliate Visibility:**  
  Ensure the "ratte" brand is clearly represented and that your affiliate links and coupon codes are highly accessible without obstacles (i.e. no scraper protection) so that search engines and third-party aggregators can index the content easily.

- **Enhanced Revenue Generation:**  
  Maximize affiliate revenue by ensuring that search engines and coupon sites can access, index, and recommend your affiliate codes and links.

- **Optimized SEO & Discoverability:**  
  Use best practices for on-page SEO—structured content, targeted meta tags, and semantic markup—to boost search engine visibility. No advanced protection measures (such as CAPTCHAs or heavy bot detection) will be deployed to allow scrapers and search engines to freely collect data.

- **User Engagement & Analytics:**  
  Include click analytics placeholders to monitor engagement, with plans to scale this up as needed.

- **Modern & Responsive Design:**  
  Build a responsive, single-page React application with Tailwind CSS, supporting a dark mode and a light mode toggle that is optimized for performance across all devices and browsers.

## Scope and Features

### Functional Requirements

1. **Header Section:**
   - Prominent display of branding (name, handle, tagline).
   - Include a navigation area if necessary and the dark/light mode toggle.
  
2. **Content Section:**
   - **Social Media & Affiliate Links:**  
     Each link (Twitch, Discord, YouTube, TikTok, Steam, X (Twitter), KICK, tradelink, csfloat, skinport, settings, peripherals, eliteklan, gamerbulk, acezone, skinvault) is presented with:
     - **Clean URL Display and Text Label:** (e.g., "› twitch ‹")
     - **Directly Accessible URLs:** Links that can be indexed by scrapers and search engines without protection.
     - **UI Controls:** Visual elements like "Share this link now", "Redirect", "Thumbnail", "Prioritize", "Schedule", "Lock", and "Analytics" will be rendered as static placeholders (with potential enhancements later).
     - **Analytics Data:** Display initial static click counts.
   - **Affiliate Codes/Coupons Display:**  
     Special coupon codes (e.g., code "ratte" for discounts on merch, gamerbulk orders, acezone, skinvault, etc.) with corresponding affiliate links. These sections will be structured with rich snippets that coupon sites and search engines can index, further driving revenue.

3. **Footer Section:**
   - Contact and additional branding elements, including your email address (ratte@seweraim.com) and social media mentions.
   - Copyright and any legal disclaimers.

4. **SEO & Content Optimization:**
   - Use structured and semantic HTML5 (using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`).
   - Implement targeted meta tags (title, description, canonical URLs) specifically crafted to promote your affiliate offers, including appropriate rich snippet and schema markup where applicable.
   - **Open Access for Indexing:**  
     No measures will be implemented to block web crawlers and scrapers, ensuring maximum visibility in search engines and aggregate coupon sites.
   - Consider inclusion of FAQ or additional supporting content (e.g., affiliate policies, discount explanations) to further boost SEO.

### Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:**  
  The site must load quickly and be optimized in performance via rspack/rsbuild bundling, ensuring minimal JavaScript payload and fast image loads.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  The UI should be fully responsive, supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes, with full cross-browser compatibility.

- **Accessibility:**  
  Adhere to accessibility standards with appropriate ARIA roles and contrast compliance, making the site usable by as many users as possible.

- **Maintainability:**  
  The code should be well-documented and modular to allow for future iterative improvements.

- **Open Visibility for SEO:**  
  As per your requirement, no anti-bot, anti-scraping, or heavy rate-limiting security measures will be implemented so that search engines and third-party scrapers can freely index the content.

## Success Metrics

  High ranking for targeted search keywords and a strong presence on coupon aggregation sites.
- **User Engagement:**  
  Monitored via displayed click counts (both on the site and later through integrated analytics).
